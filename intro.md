## Who is Isaac?
 > My name is Isaac Nelson, I am very new to coding and incredibly excited to learn! My coding experience thus far is just a few months of self study and online prep courses starting August 1st. I am passionate about creating a successful future for my family and myself. My beautiful wife Alexandra is pregnant with our first child, "Miles". Miles should be joining us around January 10th 2020, with such a soon delivery date I am more motivated than ever to learn the skills for a successful future.
