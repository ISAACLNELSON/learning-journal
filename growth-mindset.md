## What is Growth Mindset?

> Growth Mindset is never giving up *especially* when you do not understand the content you are trying to learn. For a proper Growth Mindset you must use all assets at your disposal, and never stop trying until you have the problem solved.
### My Reminders to Keep a Growth Mindset

1. If I feel confused...
  - Ask someone! Or take a breather.
2. If I start comparing myself to others...
  - Remember that everyone starts out somewhere, and we all progress differently!
3. If I think I've learned enough...
  - Dont get cocky, There is ***always*** more to learn!
