# My Cheat Sheet

###some of the most important features when considering a text editor..
1. code completion
  - code completion is when your editor predicts the end of your code for you, saving you from typing it out all the way.
2. syntax highlighting
  - syntax highlighting is when the editor organizes all attributes by changing the text color to the corresponding attribute color
3. a nice variety of themes
  - different themes can help with eye strain
4. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them
  - extensions give you the ability to do more with that same text editor adding functionality as needed
### other notes about using editors
- always save your documents with the correct extensions at the end of the file name.
  - i.e the main html file should be called index.html since it is an html file.
