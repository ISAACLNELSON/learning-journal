# Problem Domain
Coding is like putting together a jigsaw puzzle, so what makes a particular piece of code difficult o write is the same thing that makes a challenging jigsaw puzzle hard to complete... The problem domain, for instance on a difficult puzzle there may be multiple pieces that are almost identical and your not sure how they fit together. The same can be said when writing a lengthy function in Javascript, you may know what the end result needs to be and you may know the pieces you need to make it work! On the lab 5 I was working on question 6 and I knew i had to iterate over the input array, so i knew i needed a for loop, but what went inside the loop took me a while to figure out... This was happening to me because I didnt fully understand the problem. As a developer the variable that makes writing code easy or hard is how well you understand the problem domain. 

There are two ways to remedy an challenging problem domain...
1. Make the problem domain easier to understand!
    - "You can often make the problem domain easier by cutting out cases and narrowing your focus to a particular part of the problem." - [article](https://simpleprogrammer.com/understanding-the-problem-domain-is-the-hardest-part-of-programming)

    - Also as stated in the article, you should treat it like a game. break down what you need to do level by level. Ask yourself, What is your level one for this problem? Once you have managed that you can introduce another factor within that problem.
2. Get a better understanding of the project domain...
    - "It is easy to fall into the trap of thinking you understand enough of the problem to get started coding it." - [article](https://simpleprogrammer.com/understanding-the-problem-domain-is-the-hardest-part-of-programming)

    - My personal advice for this is to make a full plan in psuedocode. What needs to happen to fulfil the expected result. Then you can break it up while keeping it in easy to understand wording so you dont confuse yourself later!
