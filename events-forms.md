# Events in Javascript

Javascript has the ability to keep track of lots of interactions the user has between the computer, these interactions are called events.

Here is how events trigger Javascript code..
1. first select the element you want the script to respond to.
2. indicate which event you want to trigger the response.
3. start the code you want to run when the event occurs.

# Forms

A way to capture these user events is through forms, of course as the name implies, forms are also used for collecting data. They go hand in hand with events in Javascript. You can input data, hit submit which is a triggering event, the JS code then takes that data from the form and does whatever you would like with it!

## Form example
`<form>`
`<label for="name">Name:</label>`
`<input name="name" type="text" />`
`</form>`

This form asks the user for their name.
