#Computer Notes
## What makes a computer a computer?
     A computer must
        - input
        - store
        - process
        - and output information!

## How do they work.
    computers are funny because while you think they know all this different incredible information, in reality the only thing they understand is 1 and 0. 
    This is called binary, computers are amazing because they can

- take tons of information in a language they dont inherently understand...
- translate it into their language...
- store the info
- process the info
- and output a result

    All before you could blink!

    knowing this has helped me have a much deeper understanding of how computers work, for instance videos. How in the world does a bunch of ones and zeroes create a moving image? Well when you break it down a video is simply many, many still images moving along. ok but how can it even process numbers to pictures? whenyou look at a picture on a screen it is made up of millions of pixels, and each pixel is displaying a specific color! knowing this and what we learned in class from css we know that colors can just be a sequence of numbers, like the hexa decimal method!

## How does the binary work?
    binary means there are only 2 results, 1 or 0, on or off, true or false. This can be produced from one wire or "bit", does it have power through it? 1. does it have no power? 0. of course we need more than one wire to create the technology you see today, this is acheived through circuits. circuits are basically a collection of wires, the more circuits you have the more bits you have, and the more bits the more computing power!
