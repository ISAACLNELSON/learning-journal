# Another CSS Layout entry

New concepts I gathered from this read-through.
- z-index, I will try and implement this into my page when things are behind elements that they shouldnt be.
- relative postioning, Now i get that relative is in relation to where the element starts out at.
- fixed positioning, This is used for elements that are always on screen, although it can be considered very annoying, lilke an ad for example.
-clear, I will definitely be using this starting today, clear:(direction); will ensure there is no other elements on the corresponding side within the same parent box.
- float problem! its possible that if every element wihtin the parent is floated, then the browser will register it as 0px tall! in other words if you wanted to stylize that parent element you wouldnt be able to.
  -float solution, give the parent an overflow: auto; && width: 100%; this will fix this problem!
