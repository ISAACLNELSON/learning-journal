# JavaScript Notes
> Javascript is the final piece of the web development puzzle. JS adds all the true functionality to a page, anything that requires logic, movement,data gathering, and much more. The possibilities with JS are endless. 
## Creating a JS file
> Create a js file by adding .js to the end of a new file.
       
        - example: filename.js

## Linking to HTML 
> You can link your js file to html by adding a script tag, this will create an inline link to the js file...

    - example: <script src="js/filename.js"></script>
    This will link the html to the logic and functions within the js file.
## Javascript runs where you put it in HTML
> simply wherever you place the script for your js file within your html, that is where you will find that on your webpage.
